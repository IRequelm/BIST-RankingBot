## Decision

- Is pure active Top3 still worth paper trading? No. It delivered -4.96% excess CAGR versus BIST100 in this walk-forward.
- Does benchmark-core improve robustness? Yes. Core policies reduce active drawdown and tracking error mechanically, but must be checked against BIST100 drag.
- Best balance of CAGR, drawdown, and excess return: Policy A — BIST100 only (CAGR 29.17%, max drawdown -17.72%, excess CAGR 0.00%).
- Best fixed benchmark-core allocation if an active sleeve must be retained: Policy C — 80/20 benchmark-core (active allocation 20.00%, excess CAGR -0.68%).
- Best dynamic benchmark-core/satellite variant: Policy G — Drawdown-aware active overlay (active allocation average 13.55%, excess CAGR -0.03%).
- Next paper-trading candidate: Policy A — BIST100 only.
- Active stock-picking should be demoted from main strategy to satellite only unless it regains persistent benchmark-relative edge.

## Acceptance Criteria

A new candidate must improve robustness versus pure active Top3 and avoid material historical underperformance versus BIST100. June 2026 improvement alone is not sufficient.
